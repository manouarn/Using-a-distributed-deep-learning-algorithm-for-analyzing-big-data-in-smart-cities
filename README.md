# Using-a-distributed-deep-learning-algorithm-for-analyzing-big-data-in-smart-cities
mart cities are an important area of research. Several research projects have proposed an
architecture to address the processes in smart cities. As a result, this paper introduced a
distributed architecture for deep learning based on Big Data in smart cities. The proposed
architecture addresses the process of data mining in smart cities, in particular data
acquisition, storage, and analysis. The proposed architecture processes Big Data in smart
cities that are geographically distributed and characterized by variety, volume, and velocity.
Therefore, distributed clusters were proposed to store the data. The deep learning model
can train distributed data to build the best model. A framework was developed to validate the
importance of the proposed approach. The component of the framework was Hadoop for data
storage and the Python programming language to develop a machine learning model. The
proposed architecture was applied in the Smart environment to create models that describe
Toluene forecasting and Smart Energy to describe wind energy forecasting.
Finally, two cases were compared; in the first case, two clusters were used, and in the
second, only one cluster was used. The comparison between the Internal Mean Square Error
and the Mean Square Error and the timely execution of the two used cases demonstrated the
importance of the proposed architecture.
Based on the results of this study, as part of future work, an alternative deep learning
algorithm, such as the convolution neural network and the auto-encoder, will be applied.
